Configuration files can be found in arch/arm64/configs.

How to build your kernel:

  Prerequisites:

    * [Clang](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/)
    (r530567 test passed)

    * The ARM cross-compiler
      You can use prebuild executable binary which is included in
      standard Android repository. Please visit to external site.
      In case of this platform, we recommend to use gcc 4.9 or later
      such as aarch64-linux-android-4.9 to avoid known issues.
      
      [LineageOS/gcc4.9](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_prebuilts_gcc_linux-x86_aarch64_aarch64-linux-android-4.9)
      (branch lineage-19.1 test passed)



  Step 1: Build Your Kernel
    $ cd kernel_source_folder

    $ export ARCH=arm64

    $ export PATH=<path-to-cross-compiler-executables>:$PATH
      NOTE: Please set the location of the ARM cross-compiler.

    $ export CROSS_COMPILE=<toolchain-prefix>
      NOTE: Please set the prefix of the ARM cross-compiler.
            ex) aarch64-linux-android-

    $ make himiko_defconfig O=./out

    $ PATH="<path-to-clang-executables>:<path-to-gcc-executables>:${PATH}" \
make -j$(nproc --all) O=./out \
                      ARCH=arm64 \
                      CC=clang \
                      CLANG_TRIPLE=aarch64-linux-gnu- \
                      CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-android- 
                 
  	NOTE: Please set the prefix of the ARM cross-compiler.
            ex) aarch64-linux-android-
            
    You can see arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz-dtb if you succeed in building.


  Step 2: repack and flash
    (In the Linux Kernel directory)
    $ repack
    
    You can see two zip archive files. Flash them.
